Title: Card Management System

Description:
The "Card Management System" is a C program that simulates a basic banking application. It allows users to interact with their virtual bank account by entering their card number and a predefined PIN. Users can perform operations such as checking the card type, verifying the PIN, checking the account balance, making deposits, and withdrawing money.

Features:
1. Card Identification:
   - The program identifies the type of card based on the first digit of the entered card number and its length.
   - Supported card types are Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.

2. PIN Verification:
   - Users are required to enter a predefined PIN (55555) to access their account.
   - The program validates the correctness of the entered PIN.

3. Account Balance:
   - After successful PIN verification, users can view their account balance.
   - The account balance is randomly generated for demonstration purposes.

4. Deposits:
   - Users can deposit money into their account.
   - The program allows users to specify the amount to deposit, and the new balance is updated accordingly.

5. Withdrawals:
   - Users can withdraw money from their account.
   - The program checks if the requested withdrawal amount is available in the account balance and updates the balance accordingly.
   - It prevents users from withdrawing more money than they have in their account.

Advantages:
1. Simple and Easy to Use:
   - The program provides a straightforward user interface, making it easy for users to interact with their virtual account.

2. Learning and Educational:
   - This project serves as a valuable learning tool for those new to programming in C.
   - It covers essential concepts such as input/output, conditional statements, loops, and string manipulation.

3. Customizable:
   - Developers can extend this program by adding additional features, such as implementing user account authentication or saving user data to a file.

4. Real-world Application:
   - While this is a basic simulation, similar logic is used in real-world banking applications for card verification and transaction processing.

5. Random Account Balance:
   - The program generates a random account balance to simulate real-life scenarios.
   - This helps users understand how to handle different account balances during deposits and withdrawals.

Please Note:
- This program is intended for educational and illustrative purposes only.
- It does not incorporate actual security features used in real banking applications and should not be used for actual financial transactions.

Usage:
1. Enter your card number when prompted.
2. Enter the PIN as 55555.
3. The program will verify your card type and PIN.
4. Upon successful verification, you can choose to deposit or withdraw money from your account.
5. The account balance will be updated accordingly after each transaction.
